This is a simple game lobby system where users can join a timed game session, pick a number between 1–9, and compete to win. The project consists of:

## 🔐 Features

### ✅ Authentication (JWT)
- Simple username-based login
- JWT-secured routes
- Users cannot log in if they already have an active session

### 🎮 Game Logic

- Select a number between 1–9
- A random winning number is selected when the session ends
- Winners are determined and stored
- Sessions are stored in the database
- Users can leave a session before it starts
- First-in queue replaces any user who leaves
- Sessions auto-close after 20 seconds (or configured time)

### 🏆 Leaderboard & Stats

- View winners grouped by **day**, **week**, or **month**
